    "**EDA** is a crucial step in any Machine Learning pipeline.\n",
    "It helps you **understand your data** before using it to train a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Main Reasons for Performing EDA:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Understand the Data Structure** 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the features (columns)?\n",
    "* What is the target (label)?\n",
    "* What data types are present?\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Example: Is \"Age\" stored as an integer or string?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Detect Missing or Invalid Data** ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "* EDA helps you find **null values**, **outliers**, or **inconsistent entries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Example: \"Salary\" has some missing values or negative numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Identify Feature Distributions** 📈\n",
    "\n",
    "* See how values are spread (normal distribution, skewed, etc.)\n",
    "* Helps decide if **scaling or transformation** is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Reveal Patterns and Relationships** 🔍\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **correlation heatmaps** and **scatter plots** to find relationships between variables.\n",
    "* Helps in **feature selection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Example: \"Experience\" and \"Salary\" are strongly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Detect Outliers** 🚨\n",
    "\n",
    "* Outliers can distort model training and metrics.\n",
    "* EDA helps visualize and handle them using boxplots or z-scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Understand Class Imbalance** ⚖️\n",
    "\n",
    "* In classification problems, check if one class dominates.\n",
    "* Helps decide whether to use **resampling**, **class weights**, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Example: 90% of your data belongs to class A — this needs fixing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Build Intuition** 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "* Before letting an algorithm make decisions, **you** should understand what’s going on in the data.\n",
